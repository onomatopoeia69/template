 
  i use a view templating called 'twig' as a view template, so this view templating are different 
  because it must have an extension .twig and not recognize any php code (you must pass the data first) so it is 
  another different syntaxes. 

  And use a extension such as twig in vscode for syntax highlighting.

  For documentation see: https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html
